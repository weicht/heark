**Healthy Work Style**

This is a pet project to learn some new skills based on my work environment.

**History:**

A year ago, I started working out and my trainer recommended a standing desk vs sitting all day.  Eventually, I took that plunge and am very happy with the decision.  One thing I noticed myself doing was tracking how much time I was standing vs sitting.  As I got more accustomed to standing, I noticed the balance shifting towards more of a "standing day."  To track this, I was writing on my whiteboard the hours I stood vs sit.

Also at my trainer's recommendation, I needed to start drinking more water to keep up with the fitness program I was on.  This meant going from the typical 16oz per day to 100oz.  Again, this was something I tracked on my whiteboard.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to learn some new hands-on development skills while building something I can actually use.  Just picking up a book and trying to follow through like a college course just doesn't cut it these days.  I need something I can use to see benefit.  So, I intend to take my "whiteboard tracking" and make a webapp out of it.

**Technical Details:**

These are the tools/skills I hope to use...

* git/github - for source code control and hosting
* Python - the glue to put all this together
* MongoDB - for the backend repository.  I want to store "events" (ie. stood, sat, drank).
* Flask - web framework for providing RESTful services
* Jinja2 - template engine for html interface
* Bootstrap - for style
* RabbitMQ (maybe) - just for architectural pattern sake, I may add a message queue as I have been playing with this lately.

**Architecture Stack:**

* Frontend: HTML, Jinja2, Bootstrap
* Webapp Framework:  Flask, RESTbased services
* Data Tier:  MongoDb
